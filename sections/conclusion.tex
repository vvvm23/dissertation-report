In this work, we proposed using denoising autoencoders for the
non-autoregressive prediction of VQ latents. This enables fast sampling
times and flexible inpainting. In addition, we made changes to the hourglass
transformer architecture to make it more suited for two-dimensional signals.
Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach by training a
VQ-GAN at extremely high resolutions and training our model on the resulting
latent dataset. Ultimately, this allows for the sampling of high quality and
diverse $1024 \times 1024$ images in mere seconds. Further work is required to
improve sampling time further -- closing the gap with single-step methods like
GANs -- and to improve the reconstruction quality of VQ-GAN when operating at
high downsampling factors.

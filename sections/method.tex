% TODO: figures for the following:
% - Latent dataset generation
% - High level overview of hourglass
% - 2d aware modifications: 2d rotary embeddings and downsampling in two
%   directions (showing failings of previous)
% - show training procedure (original z, corruption function, unrolled
%   training). show samples at each step? or save for eval
% - show sampling procedure (random z_0, unrolled steps, show samples, binary
%   mask)
% - show inpainting procedure (modification to binary mask)
% - show some nice samples!
